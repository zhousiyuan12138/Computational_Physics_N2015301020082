The little cute mushroom in Super Mario in your terminal, animated by Python 3.

(Introducing a far much better project: [nyancat](https://github.com/taizilongxu/nyancat), also written in Python.)

Doesn't work for Windows, neither in IDLE, for it uses ANSI escape sequences to produce color, which can not be processed in both of them. For Windows users who want to show colors in their console programs, [this](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon) might help.
